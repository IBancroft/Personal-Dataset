![2020 Formula 1 Grid Position vs. Finishing Position](https://github.com/IBancroft/Personal-Dataset/blob/main/drivers2.png?raw=true)

This graph shows the total finishing positions of every driver in 2020, graphed against the total of their starting positions. The diagonal line is a reference for where finishing where they started would put them. So the drivers on the right of the line tend to finish higher than where they started and those to the left, tend to finish below where they start a race. The drivers with the highest and lowest differences between their starting and finishing positions are the labeled ones. It's no surprise to see that Raikkonen, who has driven more F1 races than anyone else in history, is able to make up the most places during races. It is surprising to see that Verstappen, considered to be one of the best young drivers, is losing the most places during races. Looking into the data though, it seems that most of these places were lost due to not being able to finish multiple races. This graph also shows that those starting in the lower positions tend to finish higher, and the drivers who typically start higher tend to finish lower.
