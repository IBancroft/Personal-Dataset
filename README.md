# 2020 Formula 1 Overtaking
# Motivation
Over the last five years I have really gotten interested in Formula 1 and learning as much as I could about it. So much of the sport nowadays is based on collecting as much data as possible, and running simulations on that data, and generating more data from that, that it only made sense to use it as the topic for a data related project. Formula 1 is also very interesting to look at as a sport because by no means is the ability of the driver directly related to the results that they get. The performance of the car usually has a larger impact on the outcome of a race. This makes comparing drivers to each other very difficult.

![2020 Formula 1 Grid Position vs. Finishing Position](https://github.com/IBancroft/Personal-Dataset/blob/main/drivers2.png?raw=true)

This graph shows the total finishing positions of every driver in 2020, graphed against the total of their starting positions. The diagonal line is a reference for where finishing where they started would put them. So the drivers on the right of the line tend to finish higher than where they started and those to the left, tend to finish below where they start a race. The drivers with the highest and lowest differences between their starting and finishing positions are the labeled ones. It's no surprise to see that Raikkonen, who has driven more F1 races than anyone else in history, is able to make up the most places during races. It is surprising to see that Verstappen, considered to be one of the best young drivers, is losing the most places during races. Looking into the data though, it seems that most of these places were lost due to not being able to finish multiple races. This graph also shows that those starting in the lower positions tend to finish higher, and the drivers who typically start higher tend to finish lower.
